ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare two lists amount_spent=[], item_type=[] to store the
amount spent and item category respectively.
Step 3: To take the target amount, declare a variable called
target_amount and take its input from the user.
Step 4: Display the various categories of money spending using print
statements.
Step 5: To get the number of items purchased by their categories use
another variable called number_items and enter the number.
Step 6: Using a for loop we will take input from the user and store
its values in a and b variables.
Step 7: Using append() we will insert elements to the lists.
Step 8: Calculate the total amount spent in the month using the
sum().
